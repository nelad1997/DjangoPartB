## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a web application using Django, based on a predefined database structure. The work includes the following steps:

## Database Integration:

Loaded predefined relations and data into the database using the provided create_table_commands.sql script and example CSV files.
Relations include movies, actors, users, and viewing data.
Homepage:

Created a homepage with a title, an image, and navigation links to other pages in the application.
## Query Results Page:

Developed a page displaying the results of three predefined queries, each presented in a table with appropriate headers.
Add Actor to Movie:

Designed a form to add an actor's participation in a movie, including fields for the actor's name, the movie title, and the requested salary.
Validated inputs and ensured logical consistency before adding the entry to the database.
## Log Viewing:

Created a form to log a userâ€™s viewing of a movie on a specific date, with fields for the user ID, movie title, viewing date, and rating.
Validated inputs against predefined rules to ensure data integrity.
## Frontend and Backend:

Used Django views to execute SQL queries and return results to HTML templates.
Included both static and dynamic elements in the application design.
